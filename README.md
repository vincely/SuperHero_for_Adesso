# SuperHero for Adesso Mobile Solutions Germany
As I have an upcoming interview in approx. 5 days, I decided to familiarize myself with the Marvel API that might be a topic during the interview. 
In this regard I will recreate the SuperHero App that shows a list of Marvel Heroes in a Grid. After clicking on one grid element the detail page will open and a description of the hero will show.

This app is using Retrofit and Moshi to handle the API.

I do not own any Marvel content shown within the app.

## Update 11. October 2022

I've implemented the main functionality of the App. There are still some things I was not able to finish due to time.

### Known Issues

The app won't work on first start if there is no internet connection.
Landscape mode is not tested at all. It should work with visibility impediments.
