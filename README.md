# SuperHero for Adesso Mobile Solutions Germany
As I have an upcoming interview in approx. 5 days, I decided to familiarize myself with the Marvel API that might be a topic during the interview. 
In this regard I will recreate the SuperHero App that shows a list of Marvel Heroes in a Grid. After clicking on one grid element the detail page will open and a description of the hero will show.

This app is using Retrofit and Moshi to handle the API.

I do not own any Marvel content shown within the app.
